Debits the end customer with the given amount |\n| **recurringPayment** | A card-absent transaction initiated by the cardholder where the cardholder does not need to enter their card details as is using the payment credential previously stored with full card data payment. A subsequent recurring payment for a Payment |\n| **subscription** | Defines periodic collection payments without further input from the customer. Frequency and amount of these automatic charges is defined by subscription plan. Subscriptions are always billed to customer's current default card |\n| **subscriptionRecurringPayment** | A subsequent recurring payment for a Subscription |\n| **refund** | Reverses a payment which was previously performed with Debit or Capture |\n| **payout** | Credits the customer's account with the given amount |\n| **pushPayment** | This order type applied in case when pix static QR payment is used: <br/>- *Pix Static QR Code* is like a single price tag. It doesn't change, and you as merchant can use it to charge multiple times the same amount for the same customer. It is therefore more flexible.  There is no any expiration date for Pix Static QR Code it is valid until recipient pix account is still active. Recipient pix account will became not active if the pix key which is used has been removed from the pix directory [DICT](https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/dict). You will be informed about this event by email in advance. <br/>- *Pix Dynamic QR Code* is different from the previous one, the dynamic QR Code is unique for each transaction and works to pay specific bills, which will only be paid once. This means that it can only be used once - to make a second charge it is necessary to generate a new one. |\n\nEach order has an unique ID (\"UUID\") which you should store within your database, as you may need it for further operations like recurring or refund.\n\n## Payments/Server-to-Server\n\n### Debit/credit card payments processing flow\n\n**Please note** that card data is collected at the merchant's side in case of this method and merchant should be PCI DSS compliant.\n\nTo initiate a payment you need to create a [request](#operation/createPayment) to get an orderId.

As a response merchant receives an orderId with `\"status\": \"pending\"`. That means that the order request payload is validated and payment is processed.\n1. After that merchant needs to get the payment status by orderId. The payment status can be received with the callback or by additional polling of request to endpoint [order check endpoint](#operation/checkOrderById) by using corresponded orderId.

If orderId has `\"status\": \"threeDSecureRequested\"` that means that additional challenge is required from the merchant's side. The merchant should make a redirect of the customer to the `acsServerUrl` received to show the customer payment portal page. Customer performs a payment through card or \"onepay\" service.\n1.

At the next step the callback will come to successUrl/failUrl depending on the order status, where there are PaymentFormId and orderId created are presented. By using PaymentFormId and orderId merchant can match initial request data with the received orderId. Once the checkout is complete, our system will redirect the customer to the redirectUrl provided in the payment form request\n6. After that merchant needs to get the payment status by orderId. The payment status can be received by the callback or by the additional polling of request to [order check endpoint](#operation/checkOrderById) by using corresponding orderId.
